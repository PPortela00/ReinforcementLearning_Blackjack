Reinforcement-Learning-Blackjack
==============================

To make the code run properly we recommend you use a IDE environment, like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, and there you open the folder with everything.
To locate the paper you can go to the folder named "reports", and the notebook in the folder "notebooks".
